# melodic_similarity
This repo hosts my MSc Thesis research in applying DNA sequencing algorithms to the task of melodic similarity.

_What does this work do?_

We are sequencing the musical genome. More specifically we are taking algorithms traditionally used in bioinformatics to perform exact and inexact matching on global and local alignments of sequences, and applying them to melodies. 

_How is this done?_

We scraped MIDI files from the Lakh dataset and have developed five text-based encodings that represent various levels of information. The rest of the research is essentially string and substring comparison measures to evaluate similarity, and applicasions thereof. Two such applications are evaluating how these algorithms perform at cover song identification in both Pop music and jazz music.

Thanks for taking the time to read! More to come here as this research has only just begun!
